I developed a simulation model to analyze the degradation of railway segments over a specified period. The model evaluates the wear level of each railway segment and determines which routes are worth preserving based on their average degradation after a given number of years.
I utilized graph theory to represent the railway network as an undirected graph, implementing adjacency lists for efficient traversal and analysis
